        <h2 align="left"> Concept </h2>
        <p> This is a Wiki about HTML, built entirely and exclusively in HTML. The purpose of this project is so that, while I'm learning HTML, I'm actively interacting and building with it. </p>           
        <p> This project was started on 26-11-2025, when I was 1 week and a half into learning HTML. </p>

        <h2 align="left"> What is HTML </h2>
        <p> 
            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. As a markup language, it serves the purpose of establishing the structure and content of a page.
            In this sense it is not a programming language like you would think of Python, C, etc. 
            An analogy often used in relation to CSS and JavaScript is that if these three were represented as a building, HTML would be the foundation, columns and pillars, CSS would be the wallpaper and decoration, and JavaScript would be the objects with which you interact inside that building.
            You could also explain it using a box as an example. HTML would set the structure of that box and the internal divisions of that box. Inside that box you would put the content of the box, still with HTML. With CSS you would stylize the shape of the compartments, the colors, the alignment, etc. With JavaScript you would set how the box opens, how objects move or are interacted with inside the box, etc.

        <h2 align="left"> The Boilerplate </h2>
        <p> 
            The boilerplate is the uppermost section of the html document. 
            This section does not appear on the page itself, since it's function is to be an entry point for how a browser opens the page. 
            It sets the document type, important metadata like title, which appears on the browser window, language of the document, important information for SEO purposes, it sets the character set, usually UTF-8, to encompass characters outside of the english lanuage, think latin languages accents or asian languages symbols.
        </p>
        <h3 align="left"> An example </h3>

        <p> This is what a boilerplate looks like. Only the body section will appear on the page, everything else is set for SEO and browser compatibility </p>

        <h1 align="center"> HTML Elements </h1>
        <h2 align="left"> What they are and how they work </h2>
        <p> HTML elements are what determines which type of content is added to the page. This could be a heading, a paragraph, an image, a video, an iframe, etc.</p>
        <p> Elements differ in syntax. H1 through H6, P, Section, Div, are elements that need to be closed, while img or video are self closing. The tag to close an element is equal to the opening tag but with a forward slash.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Example: &lt;h1&gt;  text here  &lt;/h1&gt;   </li>
        </ul>
        <p> While elements that are self closing do not need a close tag, they are <strong>self</strong>-closing </p>
        <ul>
            <li> &lt;img src="google.com/catimage.png"&gt;</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 align="left"> The difference between Non Self-Closing and Self-Closing </h2>
        <p> Non Self-closing elements, like h1, p, or ul, have to be closed to determine when their content ends. In a h1 element, for example, you write text inside it and the close tag serves to determine when the h1 text ends.</p>
        <p> Self-Closing elements, also known as Void Elements, like &lt;img&gt; or &lt;video&gt; do not have to be closed because they do not contain any content inside, they serve to link to content that is somewhere else, like an image that's on google, or a video that's on youtube. There's no need to close the void element because there's no content on the element that needs to have a defined end, only a link to external content.</p>
        <p> The difference between these two types of elements also serve as a reason as to why you can fully customize self-closing elements with CSS, while void elements have limited customization, usually reserved to size or placement, but never any attribute that modifies the content that's being linked. (Example: you can set a video to center right or left, but you can't apply a colour overlay to the video with HTML</p>

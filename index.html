            <h2> Concept </h2>
            <p> This is a Wiki about HTML, built entirely and exclusively in HTML. <br> The purpose of this project is so that, while I'm learning HTML, I'm actively interacting and building with it. </p>           
            <p> This project was started on 26-11-2025, when I was 1 week and a half into learning HTML. </p> 
            <p>*note: The light design on this page was designed for desktop. On mobile, img elements are not correctly centered. <br> This is where CSS magic would come in, but im not allowed to use it in this project :&#40; </p>

            <h1> What is HTML </h1>
            <p> 
            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. As a markup language, it serves the purpose of establishing the structure and content of a page. <br>
            In this sense it is not a programming language like you would think of Python, C, etc. 
            </p>
            <p>
            An analogy often used in relation to CSS and JavaScript is that if these three were represented as a building, HTML would be the foundation, <br> columns and pillars, CSS would be the wallpaper and decoration, and JavaScript would be the objects with which you interact inside that building.
            </p>
            <p>
            You could also explain it using a box as an example. HTML would set the structure of that box and the internal divisions of that box. <br> Inside that box you would put the content of the box, still with HTML. With CSS you would stylize the shape of the compartments, the colors, the alignment, etc. <br> With JavaScript you would set how the box opens, how objects move or are interacted with inside the box, etc.

            <h2> The Boilerplate </h2>
            <p> 
            The boilerplate is the uppermost section of the html document. 
            This section does not appear on the page itself, since it's function is to be an entry point <br> for how a browser opens the page. 
            It sets the document type, important metadata like title, which appears on the browser window, language of the document, <br> important information for SEO purposes, it sets the character set, usually UTF-8, to encompass characters outside of the english lanuage, think latin <br> languages accents or asian languages symbols.
            </p>
            <h3> An example </h3>
            <img src="./images/HTML-boilerplate.png">
            <p> This is what a boilerplate looks like. Only the body section will appear on the page, everything else is set for SEO and browser compatibility </p>

            <h1> HTML Elements </h1>
            <p> HTML elements are what determines which type of content is added to the page. This could be a heading, a paragraph, an image, a video, an iframe, etc.</p>           
            <h2> Container Tags and Empty Tags</h2>
            <p> Elements differ in syntax. H1 through H6, P, Section, Div, et cetera, are elements that need container tags, while img or video use empty tags.</p>
            <h3> Container Tags</h3>                 
            <p>Elements that use Container Tags have their content contained between two tags. Here we can see the three parts of an element that requires container tags:</p>
            <img src="./images/ContainerTagExample.png" alt="Image showing Container Tag syntax" width="500px">
            <p>The closing tag is equal to the opening tag, except it includes a forward slash before the element name.</p>
            <h3> Empty Tags </h3>
            <p> Elements that use empty tags do not need a close tag, they are <strong>self</strong>-closing. </p>         
            <img src="./images/EmptyTagExample.png" alt="Image showing Empty Tag syntax" width="500px">
            <p>Here we can see that the img element and the src and alt attributes are all contained within a singular Opening Tag. <br> This is because img is a void element, a type of element that does not actually hold any content inside of itself, <br> it simply points to content that is elsewhere, in this case a link of an image.</p>
            <p> Elements that link to content that is elsewhere on the web or a folder are not the only types of void elements. <br> For example, &lt;hr&gt; creates a dividing line that can separate two sections, like this: <hr> <br> In this sense, most void elements either serve the purpose of linking to external content, or serve <br> the purpose of creating structure markers, like these lines. &lt;hr&gt; has pretty much been made obsolete, <br> because it holds no semantic value and all the styling value has been deferred to CSS. </p>
